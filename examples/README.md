## Roles from service

A role is a *principal* that usually depends on the relation between a user and a resource. For example, `alice` is the `author` of `articles/42`.

Since it's not the responsability of the *Identity Provider* nor *Doorman* to manage this relation, the service sends the roles of the current user in the authorization request `context`.

For instance, for a service where objects and users are stored in its database (e.g Django), the service will:

1. verify and read the JWT payload to get the authenticated userid
1. fetch the resource attributes and lookup the user in the database
1. determine the user roles with regards to this object (eg. `author`, `collaborator`, or global `superuser`...)
1. send an authorization request to Doorman with roles in the context field

And Doorman will match rules and determine if the user is allowed to perform the specified action on the specified resource

In the example below, we rely on the groups of given by the *Identity Provider* to allow creating articles, and on the roles provided by the service to determine who can edit them:

```yaml
service: gurghruin435u85O539g7cKvWBOI
jwtIssuer: https://auth.mozilla.auth0.com/
policies:
  -
    id: create-articles
    description: Members of the moco group can create articles
    principals:
      - group:moco
    actions:
      - create
    resources:
      - article
    effect: allow
  -
    id: edit-articles
    description: Authors and collaborators can edit articles
    principals:
      - role:author
      - role:collaborator
    actions:
      - read
      - update
    resources:
      - article
    effect: allow
  -
    id: super-users
    description: Superusers can do everything
    principals:
      - role:superuser
    actions:
      - <.*>
    resources:
      - <.*>
    effect: allow
```

An authorization request sent from the service can look like this (here, the user is author of the article):

```
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/allowed \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Origin: gurghruin435u85O539g7cKvWBOI"
-d @- << EOF

{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "article",
  "context": {
    "roles": ["author"]
  }
}
EOF
```

Which in this case returns:

```json
{
  "allowed": true,
  "principals": [
    "userid:mleplatre",
    "role:author",
    "group:moco",
    "group:irccloud",
    "group:vpn",
    "group:cloudservices"
  ]
}
```

## Doorman tags

For example, you want to use Doorman to maintain a carefully curated list of people who should become "superusers" when they log in to a certain service. This means the service doesn't have to rely on an *Identity Provider* nor build the functionality to promote and demote superusers.

To do that, we define a tag `superuser` along with the intended principals in the service configuration. And then in the policies rules, we refer to this tag as the `tag:superuser` principal.

```yaml
service: https://api.service.org
jwtIssuer:  # disabled
tags:
  superuser:
    - userid:maria
    - group:admins
policies:
  -
    id: super-users
    description: Superusers can do everything
    principals:
      - tag:superuser
    actions:
      - <.*>
    resources:
      - <.*>
    effect: allow
```

In the example above, the userid `maria` or the members of the `admins` group are allowed to perform any action on any resource on the `https://api.service.org` service.

Since in this case we didn't enable JWT verification, an authorization request specifies the `principals` and looks like this:

```
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/allowed \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Origin: https://api.service.org"
-d @- << EOF

{
  "principals": ["userid:maria", "group:employees", "group:france"]
  "action": "disable",
  "resource": "notifications"
}
EOF
```

Which in this case returns:

```json
{
  "allowed": true,
  "principals": [
    "userid:maria",
    "tag:superuser",
    "group:employees",
    "group:france"
  ]
}
```
